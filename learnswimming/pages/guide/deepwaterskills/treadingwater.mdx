# Treading Water

Treading water is an essential skill that allows you to stay afloat in one place without swimming forward. It's an extremely important safety skill and is a crucial skill to master as a lifesaving skill. 

Before you start, make sure you learn the Whip Kick. The Whip Kick is a easier kick to start learning treading water with. You can learn it in the [Breaststroke Guide](../../../guide/basicskills/scissorkick.mdx).

You can also use the eggbeater kick as a more advanced alternative. It's more difficult to learn, but once you master it, your treading becomes much more efficient. Check out the [Eggbeater Guide](../../../guide/advancedskills/eggbeater.mdx) for more information.

## Treading Water Arms

Also known as sculling, treading water arms involves moving your arms in a circular motion to help you stay afloat. It's a simple technique that helps you maintain balance and stability while treading water.

- Start by standing in chest-deep water or a comfortable depth where you can maintain an upright position. Keep your body vertical with your head above the water's surface. Relax your shoulders and maintain a natural posture.

- Extend your arms in front of you towards the horizon, keeping them slightly bent at the elbows. 

- Keep your fingers together and curve your palms slightly as if holding a small ball. This creates a slight resistance in the water that aids in your floatation.

- Begin moving your hands back and forth. This motion creates lift and helps you maintain balance and stability while treading water.

## Complete Treading Water

- Start in a vertical position in deep water, with your arms at your sides.

- Perform the Whip kick while simultaneously moving your arms.

- Keep your head above water and maintain a steady rhythm with your arm and leg movements.

- Begin by attempting to tread water for 30-second intervals, then rest. As you grow more comfortable, increase this duration to a minute, then two, gradually building up your endurance.

### Maintaining Balance and Buoyancy

Treading water requires a combination of balance and buoyancy. Balance keeps you upright, while buoyancy, the force that helps you float, keeps your head above water. The goal is to use these forces to maintain a vertical position in the water.

**Tips**

- Keep your head above water and your body vertical. Try to keep your chin up and avoid leaning your head back too much, as it can cause your legs to sink.

- Relax your shoulders and maintain a natural posture. Focus on keeping your shoulders relaxed and down, allowing your arms to move freely. Tensing up can lead to unnecessary strain and fatigue, making it harder to maintain buoyancy.

- Keep your arms and legs moving in a steady rhythm. Find a rhythm that works for you and maintain a steady pace without exhausting yourself too much.

- As you practice, remember it's okay to take breaks and go at your own pace. Keep calm and don't panic if you find it challenging at first.
