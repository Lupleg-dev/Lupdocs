# Example 1: Implementing a Stack using an Array

**Scenario:** : You are building a software that needs to handle undo operations. 
For this purpose, you need to implement a stack data structure.

**Task:** Implement a stack using an array in C++. 
Provide methods for push, pop, and peek operations.
## Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Stack {
private:
    int top;
    int capacity;
    int* array;

public:
    Stack(int size) {
        capacity = size;
        array = new int[capacity];
        top = -1;
    }

    Stack() {
        delete[] array;
    }

    void push(int value) {
        if (top >= capacity - 1) {
            cout << "Stack Overflow\n";
            return;
        }
        array[++top] = value;
    }

    int pop() {
        if (top < 0) {
            cout << "Stack Underflow\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return array[top--];
    }

    int peek() {
        if (top < 0) {
            cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return array[top];
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return top == -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Stack stack(5);
    stack.push(10);
    stack.push(20);
    stack.push(30);

    cout << "Top element is: " << stack.peek() << endl;
    cout << "Popped element is: " << stack.pop() << endl;
    cout << "Top element is: " << stack.peek() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
 ### Explanation:
#### Array:
- An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access via indexing.
- Arrays provide a simple way to allocate and manage memory for a collection of elements. They are ideal for scenarios where the size of the collection is known in advance and does not change dynamically.
- In this implementation, an array is used to store the elements of the stack. The array's size (capacity) is specified when the stack is initialized, and memory is allocated accordingly.

#### Stack Class:
- The Stack class uses an array to store elements. Arrays provide a contiguous block of memory, allowing efficient indexing and storage of elements.

#### Data Members:
- top: Index of the top element.
- capacity: Maximum number of elements.
- array: Dynamically allocated array.

#### Methods:
- Constructor: Initializes the stack and allocates memory.
- Destructor: Frees allocated memory.
- push(int value): Adds an element to the stack.
- pop(): Removes and returns the top element.
- peek(): Returns the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.

#### Main Function:

- Creates a stack with capacity 5.
- Pushes elements 10, 20, and 30.
- Uses peek to show the top element.
- Uses pop to remove the top element and peek again to show the updated top element.


  # Example 2: Binary Search in a Sorted Array
  **Scenario:** You are developing a search feature for an application
  where the data is stored in sorted arrays.

### Why Binary Search Requires a Sorted Array
Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the array is not sorted, this method of narrowing down the search interval does not work, as the order of elements is unpredictable. A sorted array ensures that binary search can correctly determine whether to search the left or right half at each step.
  
  **Task:** Implement binary search in a sorted array in C++.
  The function should return the index of the target element if found, otherwise -1 .
# Example:
  ```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int binarySearch(int array[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (array[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        if (array[mid] < target)
            left = mid + 1;
        else
            right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int array[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
    int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    int target = 10;
    int result = binarySearch(array, size, target);
    if (result != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index " << result << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found in array" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
#### Initialization:
- Start with defining two pointers, left and right, which represent the current search range within the array.
- left is initially set to 0, representing the beginning of the array.
- right is set to size - 1, where size is the number of elements in the array, representing the end of the array.

#### Search Loop:

- **While left is less than or equal to right:**
  - Calculate the middle index mid of the current left and right pointers using the formula:
`mid = left + (right - left) / 2`
This formula avoids potential overflow when calculating the midpoint for large arrays.

#### Comparison:

##### Compare the target element with the element at the mid index (array[mid]):
- **If array[mid] equals the target:**
  - Return mid, indicating that the target element has been found.
- **If array[mid] is less than the target:**
  - Adjust the left pointer to mid + 1, narrowing the search to the right half of the array.
- **If array[mid] is greater than the target:**
  - Adjust the right pointer to mid - 1, narrowing the search to the left half of the array.

#### Repeat:
- Continue this process, dividing the search interval in half each time, until either the target element is found or the left pointer exceeds the right pointer.

#### Termination:
- If the loop exits and the target element has not been found (left > right), return -1 to indicate that the element is not present in the array.




# Example 3: Implementing a Queue using Linked List

**Scenario:** : You are designing a system that processes tasks in a first-come, firstserved manner. For this, you need a queue data structure.

## Explanation: Linked List in Data Structure
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains two parts:

- **Data:** This holds the actual value or information that the node is storing.
- **Pointer (or Reference):** This points to the next node in the sequence, linking the nodes together sequentially.
Linked lists differ from arrays in that they do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node can be located anywhere in memory, and its next pointer directs to the next node, forming a chain-like structure.
Linked lists offer advantages such as dynamic size adjustment and efficient insertion and deletion operations, making them suitable for scenarios where frequent data manipulation is required. However, they typically require more memory per element due to the overhead of storing pointers/references.

**Task:** Implement a queue using a linked list in C++. Provide methods for enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.

## Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Queue {
private:
    Node* front;
    Node* rear;

public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    void enqueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        if (rear == nullptr) {
            front = rear = newNode;
            return;
        }
        rear->next = newNode;
        rear = newNode;
    }

    int dequeue() {
        if (front == nullptr) {
            cout << "Queue Underflow\n";
            return -1;
        }
        Node* temp = front;
        front = front->next;
        if (front == nullptr)
            rear = nullptr;
        int value = temp->data;
        delete temp;
        return value;
    }

    int getFront() {
        if (front == nullptr) {
            cout << "Queue is Empty\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return front->data;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue queue;
    queue.enqueue(10);
    queue.enqueue(20);
    queue.enqueue(30);

    cout << "Front element is: " << queue.getFront() << endl;
    cout << "Dequeued element is: " << queue.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Front element is: " << queue.getFront() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
 ### Explanation:

#### Node Class:
- Node represents each element in the linked list.
- It has two members:
  - data: Holds the integer value of the node.
  - next: Points to the next node in the linked list.

#### Queue Class:
- Queue manages the queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, getFront, isEmpty) using linked list nodes.
- It has two private member variables:
  - front: Points to the first node in the queue.
  - rear: Points to the last node in the queue.

#### Constructor (Queue()):
- Initializes **front** and **rear** pointers to **nullptr**, indicating an empty queue.

#### Enqueue (enqueue(int value)) Method:
- Creates a new node with the given value.
- If the queue is empty (rear is nullptr), sets both front and rear to the new node.
- Otherwise, appends the new node at the end of the queue (rear) and updates rear.

#### Dequeue (dequeue()) Method:
- Removes and returns the front element from the queue.
- Checks if the queue is empty (front is nullptr).
- Moves front to its next node (front = front->next).
- If front becomes nullptr after dequeuing the last element, sets rear to nullptr.
- Deletes the temporary node and returns its data.

#### Get Front (getFront()) Method:
- Returns the value of the front element without removing it.
- Checks if the queue is empty.
- Returns front->data if the queue is not empty.

#### Is Empty (isEmpty()) Method:
- Checks if the queue is empty by verifying if front is nullptr.
- Returns true if the queue is empty; otherwise, returns false.

#### Main Function:
- Creates an instance of Queue.
- Enqueues three elements (10, 20, 30).
- Prints the front element using getFront().
- Dequeues an element and prints the dequeued value and the new front element.





 # Example 4: Finding the Middle of a Linked List

 **Scenario:** You are analyzing a linked list to find its middle element for some processing tasks.
 
 **Task:** Implement a function to find the middle element of a singly linked list in C+

 ## Example:
 ```cpp
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

Node* findMiddle(Node* head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return nullptr;
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;
    while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
    return slow;
}

void printList(Node* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        cout << head->data << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->next = new Node(3);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new Node(5);

    cout << "Linked List: ";
    printList(head);

    Node* middle = findMiddle(head);
    if (middle != nullptr)
        cout << "Middle element is: " << middle->data << endl;
    else
        cout << "The list is empty\n";

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation:
-  The findMiddIe function uses the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
-  The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
-  When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

# Example 5: Implementing Merge Sort

**Scenario:** You are tasked with implementing a sorting algorithm for large datasets that needs to be efficient in terms of time complexity.

**Task:** Implement the merge sort algorithm in C++.

## Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void merge(int array[], int left, int mid, int right) {
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    int* L = new int[n1];
    int* R = new int[n2];

    for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
        L[i] = array[left + i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
        R[i] = array[mid + 1 + i];

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (L[i] <= R[j])
            array[k++] = L[i++];
        else
            array[k++] = R[j++];
    }

    while (i < n1)
        array[k++] = L[i++];

    while (j < n2)
        array[k++] = R[j++];

    delete[] L;
    delete[] R;
}

void mergeSort(int array[], int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        mergeSort(array, left, mid);
        mergeSort(array, mid + 1, right);
        merge(array, left, mid, right);
    }
}

void printArray(int array[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        cout << array[i] << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int array[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
    int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    cout << "Given array is \n";
    printArray(array, size);

    mergeSort(array, 0, size - 1);

    cout << "Sorted array is \n";
    printArray(array, size);

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation:
#### Array: 
- A sequence of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. In this example, arrays are used to store and sort elements.

#### Merge Function:
- Purpose: Merges two sorted subarrays back into the original array in sorted order.
- Process: Creates temporary arrays L and R to hold elements from the two subarrays, then merges them back into the original array.
#### MergeSort Function:
- Purpose: Recursively splits the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray has one element, then merges them back together.
- Process: Finds the middle point, recursively sorts the left and right halves, and merges them using the merge function.
#### Main Function:
- Purpose: Demonstrates the merge sort.
- Process: Initializes an array, prints the original array, sorts it using mergeSort, and prints the sorted array.

# Example 6: Binary Search
**Question:** Implement binary search algorithm in Java.
### Explanation: what is java
Java is a widely-used programming language known for its portability, security features, and extensive libraries. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Scenario:** You need to implement a search algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array.

**Task:** Implement the binary search algorithm in Java.

## Implementation:
```java
public class BinarySearchExample {

    // Method to perform binary search
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0; 
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Check if the target is present at mid
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // Target found
            }

            // If target is greater, ignore the left half
            if (arr[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } 
            // If target is smaller, ignore the right half
            else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // Target not found
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
        int target = 10;

        int result = binarySearch(arr, target);
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found in array");
        }
    }
}
```
## Explanation:
#### Binary Search Method:

- Parameters: Takes a sorted array arr and the target value to be searched.
-**Variables:
   - left: Starting index of the array (initially set to 0).

   - right: Ending index of the array (initially set to arr.length - 1).

#### Process:

- The while loop runs as long as left is less than or equal to right.
- Mid Calculation: int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; calculates the middle index to avoid overflow.

#### Check Mid Value:
- If arr[mid] equals the target, the target is found, and the index mid is returned.
- If arr[mid] is less than the target, search in the right half by updating left to mid + 1.
- If arr[mid] is greater than the target, search in the left half by updating right to mid - 1.
#### Return: If the target is not found, -1 is returned.

# Example 7: Implementing Bubble Sort in Java

**Task:** Implement the bubble sort algorithm in Java.

**Explanation:** Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It passes through the list multiple times until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

## Java Implementation:
```java
public class BubbleSortExample {

    // Method to perform bubble sort
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length; // Get the length of the array
        boolean swapped;    // Flag to track if any elements were swapped

        do {
            swapped = false; // Assume no swaps are needed initially

            // Iterate through the array and perform swaps
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
                    // Swap arr[i-1] and arr[i]
                    int temp = arr[i - 1];
                    arr[i - 1] = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = temp;
                    swapped = true; // Set swapped flag to true
                }
            }

            n--; // Decrease the array length after each pass
        } while (swapped); // Repeat until no swaps are needed
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};

        System.out.println("Array before sorting:");
        printArray(arr);

        bubbleSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Array after sorting:");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    // Utility method to print the elements of an array
    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

## Explanation:

#### Bubble Sort Method (bubbleSort):
- Purpose: Sorts an array arr in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm

- Variables:
  - n: Holds the current length of the array.

  - swapped: Boolean flag to indicate if any elements were swapped during 
   a pass through the array.

#### Process:
- The do-while loop executes at least once and continues as long as swapped is true, indicating that at least one swap occurred in the previous pass.
- Inside the loop, the for loop iterates through the array from index 1 to n-1.
- If arr[i-1] is greater than arr[i], the elements are swapped, and swapped is set to true.
- After each complete pass through the array (for loop), n is decremented to shorten the effective length of the array for subsequent passes.

#### Main Method:
- Initializes an array arr with unsorted elements.
- Prints the array before sorting.
- Calls bubbleSort to sort the array.
- Prints the array after sorting.

#### Utility Method (printArray):
-Prints the elements of an array for display purposes.

# Example 8: Linked List
**Question:** Implement a singly linked list in Java.

**Explanatin:** A singly linked list is a linear collection of elements where each element points to 
the next one. It consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to 
the next node in the list.

## Example: Implementing a Singly Linked List
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class SinglyLinkedList {
    Node head;

    public SinglyLinkedList() {
        this.head = null;
    }

    public void insert(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    public void display() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();
        list.insert(1);
        list.insert(2);
        list.insert(3);
        list.display(); // Output: 1 2 3
    }
}
```
#### Node Class:
- Variables:
  - data: An integer to store the value of the node.
  - next: A reference to the next node in the list.
- Constructor:
  - Initializes the data with the provided value.
  - Sets the next reference to null.

#### SinglyLinkedList Class:
- Variables:
  - head: A reference to the first node in the list.
- Constructor:
   - Initializes the head to null, indicating that the list is initially empty.

#### Methods:
- insert(int data):
  - Creates a new node with the given data.
  - If the list is empty (head is null), the new node becomes the head.
  - Otherwise, it traverses to the end of the list and appends the new node.
- **display():**
- Starts from the head and prints each node's data until it reaches the end of the list (current becomes null).

#### Main Method:
- Demonstrates the functionality of the linked list:
   - Creates an instance of SinglyLinkedList.
   - Inserts the elements 1, 2, and 3 into the list.
   - Displays the list, which results in the output: 1 2 3.

 # Example 9: Stack
 **Question:** Implement a stack using an array in Java.
**Explanation:** A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. The main operations of a stack are:

1- **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
2- **Pop:** Remove the element from the top of the stack.
3- **Peek** (or Top): Retrieve the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4- **isEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.

## Example: Stack implementation using Java
```java
public class StackExample {
    private int maxSize;    // The maximum size of the stack
    private int[] stackArray;    // Array to hold stack elements
    private int top;    // Index of the top element in the stack

    // Constructor to initialize the stack with a given size
    public StackExample(int size) {
        maxSize = size;
        stackArray = new int[maxSize];
        top = -1;    // Indicates that the stack is initially empty
    }

    // Push operation to add an element to the top of the stack
    public void push(int value) {
        if (top < maxSize - 1) {

        // Pushing elements onto the stack
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        stack.push(3);

        // Popping elements from the stack
        System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Output: 1
    }
}
```
## Explanation

#### Push Operation:
- Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Before adding, it checks if the stack is full (top < maxSize - 1). If the stack is full, it prints "Stack overflow".
- Otherwise, it increments the top index and assigns the value to the stack array at the new top position.

#### Pop Operation:
- Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- Before removing, it checks if the stack is empty (top >= 0). If the stack is empty, it prints "Stack underflow" and returns -1.
- Otherwise, it returns the element at the top of the stack and decrements the top index.

#### isEmpty Operation:
- Checks if the stack is empty.
- Returns true if top == -1, otherwise returns false.

#### Main Method
- Demonstrates the functionality of the stack:
  - Creates a stack with a capacity of 5.
  - Pushes elements 1, 2, and 3 onto the stack.
  - Uses pop to remove the top element and then shows the updated top element. The expected output for popping the elements will be 3, 2, and 1 in sequence.

# Example 10: Queue

**Question:** Implement a queue using two stacks in Java.
**Example:** A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the end (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). Implementing a queue using two stacks involves using one stack for enqueue operations and another for dequeue operations. The primary operations are:

- **Enqueue:** Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek:** Retrieve, without removing, the element at the front of the queue.
- **isEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty.

In a two-stack implementation:

- Stack1 is used to handle enqueue operations.
- Stack2 is used to handle dequeue operations.

### Main Operations in a Linked List-Based Queue
Before diving into the two-stack implementation, let's understand the main operations of a queue implemented using a singly linked list.

- **Enqueue Operation:**

  - Create a new node with the given value.
  - If the queue is empty, set both the front and rear to this new node.
  - If the queue is not empty, add the new node to the end of the queue and update the rear pointer.

- **Dequeue Operation:**

  - If the queue is empty, return an indication of an underflow condition.
 - If the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front and update the front pointer.

## Example : Implementating  Queue Using Two Stacks in Java
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class QueueUsingStacks {
    private Stack<Integer> stack1 = new Stack<>(); // Stack for enqueue operations
    private Stack<Integer> stack2 = new Stack<>(); // Stack for dequeue operations

    // Enqueue operation to add an element to the end of the queue
    public void enqueue(int item) {
        stack1.push(item);
    }

    // Dequeue operation to remove an element from the front of the queue
    public int dequeue() {
        if (stack2.isEmpty()) {
            if (stack1.isEmpty()) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Queue is empty");
            }
            // Transfer elements from stack1 to stack2, reversing the order
            while (!stack1.isEmpty()) {
                stack2.push(stack1.pop());
            }
        }
        // Return the top element of stack2, which is the front of the queue
        return stack2.pop();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        QueueUsingStacks queue = new QueueUsingStacks();
        queue.enqueue(1);
        queue.enqueue(2);
        queue.enqueue(3);
        System.out.println(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 3
    }
}
```
## Explanation:
#### Class Definition:
  - QueueUsingStacks class contains two Stack objects, stack1 and stack2.

#### Enqueue Operation:
- Method: public void enqueue(int item)
- Action: Adds an element to stack1.
- Explanation: Elements are always pushed onto stack1. This stack handles all the enqueue operations.

#### Dequeue Operation:

- Method: public int dequeue()
- Action: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
- Explanation:
  - If stack2 is empty, all elements from stack1 are transferred to stack2. This reversal of order ensures that the oldest element (FIFO) is on top of stack2.
  - If both stack1 and stack2 are empty, an IllegalStateException is thrown, indicating that the queue is empty.
  - The top element of stack2 (which is the front of the queue) is then popped and returned.

#### Main Method:

- Purpose: Demonstrates the usage of the QueueUsingStacks class.
- Actions:
  - Enqueues elements 1, 2, and 3.
  - Dequeues and prints each element, showing that elements are removed in the order they were added (FIFO).

#### Key Points:
- Enqueue: Simply push the element onto stack1.
- Dequeue: If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2 (reversing their order), then pop the top of stack2. If stack2 is not empty, directly pop from stack2.
This implementation effectively uses two stacks to simulate the behavior of a queue, ensuring that elements are dequeued in the same order they were enqueue
