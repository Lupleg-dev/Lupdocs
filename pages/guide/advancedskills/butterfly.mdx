<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
WARNING! Butterfly requires significant upper body and core strength, as well as flexibility and coordination. It involves powerful movements that put strain on various muscle groups, joints, and tendons. The most common injury is with the shoulder. The arm movements can increase the risk of shoulder injuries, including dislocations. If you have a history of shoulder injuries do not try to learn the butterfly stroke without talking to a doctor.

</Callout>

The Butterfly Stroke is one of the most challenging techniques in swimming. The combination of arm and leg movements can be demanding but also immensely rewarding once mastered.

Make sure to learn the Dolphin kick before starting this guide which is used for the leg movements for Butterfly. [Dolphin Kick Guide](../../../guide/advancedskills/dolphinkick.mdx).

## Butterfly Arms

### Understanding Butterfly Arms

The key lies in the simultaneous, circular arm movement, resembling a keyhole. Your arms should move in a circular motion above the water and then dive back in a synchronous pattern.

**Start in Streamlined Position:**
Begin by floating flat on your stomach in the water, with your arms extended straight in front of you, palms facing down, fingertips pointing forward

**Pull Phase**
From the streamlined position, start the "pull" phase. Keep your palms facing outwards and slightly downwards, bend your elbows, and pull your hands towards your body. Your hands should trace a path inwards towards the centerline of your body, then back out towards your thighs. As your arms pull down, your body should naturally rise slightly in the water.

**Push Phase:**
Once your arms reach your thighs, push your palms backwards through the water, keeping your arms mostly straight, until they're aligned with your torso. This is the 'push' phase, where you get most of your forward momentum in the stroke.

**Recovery Phase:**
After the push, it's time for the 'recovery' phase. With your palms facing down, lift your arms out of the water and swing them forwards to return to the starting streamlined position. Your arms should be straight during this recovery phase.

**Breathe:**
Breathing in the butterfly stroke happens at the end of the pull phase, just before the recovery. As your arms pull water towards your body, your shoulders and head will naturally rise out of the water. Take a quick breath before placing your face back in the water and swinging your arms forward.

**Coordinate with Dolphin Kick:**
In general, for every one cycle of the arm movements, there should be two dolphin kicks. The first kick happens as your arms enter the pull phase and the second as they enter the recovery phase.

**Timing:**
The entire arm movement should be one smooth, continuous cycle. The goal is to maintain forward momentum throughout the stroke. When your arms are pulling/pushing underwater, this drives you forward, but you can also maintain speed during the recovery by driving your arms forward quickly and diving them back into the water.

### Dryland Training

Practice the butterfly arms motion on dry land:

1. Stand upright with arms extended in front of you.
2. Move your arms outward in a circular motion, keeping them straight.
3. Bend your elbows slightly as you bring your arms back toward your chest.
4. Straighten your arms to return to the starting position.

### Pool Practice

Take the butterfly arms technique into the water:

1. Hold onto the pool's side and practice the butterfly arms motion.
2. Keep your arms straight during the recovery phase and slightly bent during the pull phase.
3. Focus on pulling water toward your chest and pushing it back behind you.

### Refining Your Technique

Refine your butterfly arms technique using these tips:

- Keep your head in a neutral position, looking down at the pool's bottom.
- Breathe during the recovery phase when your arms are out of the water.
- Maintain a close-to-surface body position and minimize drag.
- Use paddles to improve arm strength and technique.

## Practicing Butterfly

### Coordination Practice

Practice coordinating the dolphin kick and butterfly arms on dry land: Lie on your stomach and perform the dolphin kick while simultaneously practicing the butterfly arms movement. Focus on creating a fluid motion by coordinating your arms and legs. 

### Breathing Technique

Incorporate proper breathing technique:

1. Lift your head to take a breath as your arms begin the recovery phase.
2. Keep your head neutral and close to the water's surface when not breathing.
3. Exhale underwater as your arms move through the pull phase.

### Refining Your Technique

Engage your core: While it's often overlooked, engaging your core is critical for the butterfly stroke. Your core strength will help stabilize your body in the water and provide a solid foundation for the undulating motion of the stroke.

Don't rush: The butterfly stroke is not about how quickly you can move your arms, but the power and efficiency of your stroke. Try to be as streamlined as possible and focus on the quality of each stroke, not the quantity.

## Common Mistakes in Butterfly

Here are some common mistakes in the butterfly stroke and their solutions:

### Lifting the Head Too High

**Problem:** Lifting the head too high during breathing can cause the hips to drop, increasing drag and reducing efficiency.

**Solution:** Keep the chin close to the water's surface when taking a breath. Focus on a forward breath rather than an upward one.

### Inefficient Arm Recovery

**Problem:** Bending the arms too much or keeping them too wide during the recovery phase can reduce efficiency and increase fatigue.

**Solution:** Keep the arms straight and close to the water's surface during recovery. Move them in a controlled, circular motion.

### Insufficient Dolphin Kick

**Problem:** A weak or inconsistent dolphin kick can hinder an efficient butterfly stroke.

**Solution:** Focus on developing a strong and consistent dolphin kick. Initiate the kick from the core and hips while maintaining a fluid leg motion.

## Butterfly Drills
Try these drills to improve your butterfly stroke technique:

### One-Arm Butterfly

**Purpose:** Isolate each arm to focus on proper arm movement and recovery.

**How to do it:**

1. Swim the butterfly stroke with one arm while keeping the other arm extended in front.
2. Switch arms after a set distance.
3. Pay attention to proper arm recovery and maintaining a straight arm during recovery.

### Head-Lead Butterfly

**Purpose:** Focus on maintaining proper head position and breathing technique.

**How to do it:**

1. Swim the butterfly stroke while keeping your head above the water.
2. Keep your chin close to the water's surface and breathe forward.
3. After a set distance, return to regular butterfly swimming, applying the same head and breathing techniques.

### Kickboard Butterfly

**Purpose:** Concentrate on coordinating the dolphin kick and arm pull.

**How to do it:**

1. Hold a kickboard with both hands in front of you.
2. Swim the butterfly stroke, using the kickboard to maintain arm position.
3. Focus on coordinating the dolphin kick with each arm pull, ensuring a fluid and consistent motion.
