At all costs, we working extra hard to push more of our products to go enterprise. Here are only pieces of information to get you to know more about us and our capabilities towards development work with our products.

Software development safety can be broken down into two main areas: security and general safety for critical systems. Here are 5 key aspects to consider:

## Safety Development

**Secure Coding Practices:**  This involves writing code that is resistant to attacks and vulnerabilities. Developers should follow secure coding guidelines that address things like input validation, data storage, and communication protocols.

**Threat Modeling:** This proactive approach involves analyzing the software architecture to identify potential security threats and weaknesses. By anticipating these issues early on, developers can design safeguards and mitigations.

**Code Reviews:** Regularly having other developers review code can help catch errors and security vulnerabilities that the original coder might have missed. This promotes a culture of code quality and collaboration.

**Testing:** Thorough testing throughout the development lifecycle is crucial. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and security testing to identify and fix bugs before the software is released.

**Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**  This refers to a holistic approach to security that integrates security considerations into every phase of the software development process, from planning and design to deployment and maintenance.  This ensures that security is not an afterthought but a core principle from the beginning.

For software in critical systems, where failures can have serious consequences, additional safety measures are necessary:

**Rigorous Development Standards:** Safety-critical systems require adherence to strict industry standards and regulations. This ensures a high level of quality and reduces the risk of errors.

**Focus on Safety:** In safety-critical projects, the primary goal becomes safety, not speed or adding features. Developers proactively consider potential failure scenarios and design the software to be reliable and resilient.

**Detailed Documentation:** Maintaining a clear and complete record of the development process is essential for safety-critical systems. This allows for traceability and facilitates future audits and maintenance.

By following these safety principles, developers can create software that is secure, reliable, and minimizes risks.
