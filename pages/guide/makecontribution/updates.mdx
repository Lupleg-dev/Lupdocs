**Avoid Touching Marine Life**: As a general rule, you should avoid touching marine life. Many marine animals have protective mechanisms, like stings or bites, that they can use if they feel threatened. Additionally, touching marine life can damage delicate ecosystems and harm the animals.

**Be Aware of Dangerous Species**: Some marine species can pose a risk to humans. Here are a few to be aware of:

   - **Jellyfish**: Many jellyfish have tentacles that can sting. If you see a jellyfish, it's best to keep your distance.

   - **Sea Urchins**: These creatures have sharp spines that can puncture the skin and cause painful injuries.

   - **Stingrays**: Stingrays often bury themselves in the sand in shallow water. They have a sharp barb at the end of their tail that can cause serious injuries.

   - **Sharks**: While shark attacks are rare, they can happen. Avoid swimming at dawn or dusk, when sharks are most active, and stay out of the water if you have an open wound.

**Don't Feed Marine Life**: Feeding marine animals can disrupt their natural behaviors and diet. It can also make them associate humans with food, which can lead to aggressive behavior.

**Watch Out for Coral**: Coral reefs are beautiful, but they can also be dangerous. Many types of coral are sharp and can cause cuts or scrapes. Additionally, some types of coral are toxic and can cause skin irritation or other health problems.

**Be Aware of Your Surroundings**: Always keep an eye on your surroundings when you're in the water. Be aware of where you are in relation to the shore and watch out for any potential hazards, like strong currents or rapidly changing weather conditions.

**Respect Marine Life and Their Habitats**: Remember that you're a guest in the home of these marine creatures. Always treat them with respect and do your best to minimize your impact on their habitats.

**Learn About Local Marine Life**: Before you go swimming, take some time to learn about the local marine life. Knowing what types of animals you might encounter can help you stay safe.
