Diving is an essential swimming skill that allows for quick, efficient, and safe entry into the water. This guide focuses on the sequence that is considered most effective for learning - from the relatively easy and controlled kneeling dive, progressing to the more dynamic standing dive, and finally addressing the precision required for shallow dives.

## Kneeling Dives

We start with kneeling dives, which are less intimidating for beginners, offer more control, and provide a solid foundation in understanding body alignment and the basics of force application during a dive.

### Preparation

**Positioning:** Kneel on one knee at the edge of the pool, with your other foot flat on the ground in front of you, toes curled over the edge for better grip and control. This is your launching pad.

**Posture:** Keep your body leaning slightly forward, but not so much that you lose balance. Extend your arms in front of you, with palms facing down.

### Dive and Entry

**Initiation:** Lean forward, pushing off with your front foot and extending your back leg. At the same time, swing your arms down into the water to help create momentum and guide your trajectory.

**Entry:** Lead with your hands into the water, followed by your head and body. Aim to enter the water at an angle of about 30-40 degrees. This angle is critical to ensure a smooth transition from the air to the water, reducing impact, and ensuring safety.

**Glide:** Once underwater, extend your body fully and glide briefly, letting the momentum carry you forward. This phase is essential to learn how to capitalize on the dive's energy and transition smoothly into swimming.

## Standing Dives

Once you've mastered kneeling dives, you can move on to standing dives. The principles remain the same, but now the added height increases the complexity and allows for more forward momentum.

### Preparation

**Positioning:** Stand close to the edge of the pool or on the diving block, with your toes over the edge for better grip and control.

**Posture:** Bend your knees slightly and lean forward. Extend your arms in front of you, parallel to the water, with your palms facing each other. This readies your body for a strong push-off and forward motion.

### Dive and Entry

**Initiation:** Push off from the edge or block using your legs. At the same time, swing your arms down and forward into the water. Your body should follow your arms in a smooth arc.

**Entry:** Enter the water hands-first, followed by your head and the rest of your body. Remember the 30-40 degrees entry angle from the kneeling dive; it applies here as well.

**Glide:** Extend your body fully underwater and glide, using the momentum of your dive to carry you forward.
