import Image from 'next/image'

# Common Issues and Tips

How do you debug your codebase if you have some issues? Well we will clear the throat here. Here are some common issues and tips to help you debug your codebase: 
1. **Error: `next/image` requires `width` and `height` props**: 
- **Solution:** Make sure you're providing the `width` and `height` props to the `Image` component. If you're using
`next/image` with a dynamic image, you might need to use a library like `react-use-dimensions` to get the dimensions of Image
2. **Error: `next/image` requires `src` prop**:
- **Solution:** Make sure you're providing the `src` prop to the `Image` component. If you're using a dynamic image 
make sure the `src` prop is not empty or null.
3. **Error: `next/image` requires `alt` prop**:
- **Solution:** Make sure you're providing the `alt` prop to the `Image` component. This is a accessibility requirement.
4. **Error: `next/image` is not optimized for production**:

`optimizer` to your `next.config.js` file.
5. **Error: `next/image` is not working with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS**:
- **Solution:** Make sure you're using the `className` prop to add classes to the `Image` component. If you're using a CSS
framework like Tailwind CSS, you might need to add the classes to the `img` element instead of the `Image` component.
