# Introduction

This document provides information about the backend of the project. It covers the technologies used, the architecture, and the APIs.

## Technologies Used

The backend of the project is built using the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

## Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture, consisting of the following layers:

1. **Routes**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate controllers.
2. **Controllers**: Implements the business logic and interacts with the models.
3. **Models**: Defines the data schema and interacts with the database.
4. **Database**: Stores the data using MongoDB.

## APIs
