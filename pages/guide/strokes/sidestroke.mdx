The sidestroke is a classic, energy-efficient swim stroke and can be a valuable survival skill, as the sidestroke allows you to conserve energy when doing it. Unlike other strokes that requires swimmers to rotate their body or lift their head out of the water, the sidestroke allows for a more relaxed and comfortable position. 

Before learning sidestroke, make sure to familiarize yourself with the Scissorkick, an essential component of this stroke. You can find a detailed guide on it [here](../../../guide/basicskills/scissorkick.mdx).

## Arm Movement

The arm movements in side stroke are key to propelling the body forward through the water, involving a distinct push, pull, and recovery phase for both the upper and lower arm. Here's a detailed description of each phase:

### The Push

- Begin with your lower arm (the arm closest to the bottom of the pool) extended straight in front of you, palm facing down.
- Push the water downwards towards your feet by bending your elbow and pulling your arm back towards your body. 
- At the end of the push, your hand should be near your hip, palm still facing downwards.
- This push contributes significantly to forward propulsion by utilizing the large muscles of your arm and shoulder.

### The Pull

- Simultaneously, while your lower arm is initiating the push, your upper arm (the arm closest to the surface of the pool) starts its movement.
- Bend your top elbow and bring your hand towards your chest, making sure your palm is facing downwards.
- Extend your upper arm out in front of you, sweeping the water with your palm and pushing it towards your feet, akin to the lower arm action.
- This pull-push motion with your upper arm aids in propelling you forward and also helps to balance the force exerted by the lower arm.

### The Recovery

- After both arms complete their respective push and pull actions, they need to return to their starting positions in the recovery phase.
- Your lower arm, which ended near your hip, extends back straight in front of you, palm facing down, prepared for the next push.
- Meanwhile, your top arm, finishing its pull-push near the hip, recovers along your body, lying close to your side, ready to repeat the pull-push motion.
- It is essential to ensure this recovery is quick and streamlined to minimize resistance and maintain momentum in the water.

## Practicing Sidestroke

**Body position:** Start by practicing your body position in the water. The side stroke requires you to lie on your side, with one arm extended above your head and the other arm resting along your side. Keep your body aligned and straight to minimize drag.

**Scissor kick:** Begin by performing the scissor kick while maintaining your side position. The scissor kick involves extending one leg forward and the other leg backward, with a scissoring motion. Practice this kick while focusing on maintaining a steady and smooth motion.

**Arm movements:** Once you feel comfortable with the scissor kick, add the arm movements to the equation. As you perform the scissor kick, practice the arm movements for the side stroke. Start with your arms in the initial position, with one arm extended above your head and the other resting along your side. Coordinate the arm movements with the scissor kick, ensuring a smooth and fluid motion.

**Synchronization:**
Synchronization between your legs and arms is important. Start your scissor kick at the same time you start your push with your leading (bottom) arm. Finish the kick as you finish the push with your trailing (top) arm. Your arms and legs should be extended at the same time.

## Common Mistakes in Sidestroke

### Failing to Roll the Body During the Kick

Many swimmers neglect to roll their body during the kick, often because they focus too much on the forward movement and forget the importance of rotational motion. This lack of body roll results in a weak kick, hindering power and propulsion.

**Roll and Kick Drill** 

- Begin in a side position with your arms extended above your head.
- Engage your core muscles and roll your body slightly so that your chest faces the bottom of the pool.
- Perform the scissor kick, focusing on generating power and propulsion.
- Practice this drill to improve the strength and effectiveness of your kick.

### Choppiness or Lack of Rhythm in the Stroke

A choppy or uneven rhythm in the stroke is a common issue. Swimmers often fall into this mistake when they emphasize speed over technique or have yet to develop a consistent timing pattern. This lack of fluidity can interrupt the smooth progression through the water, leading to an inefficient stroke.

**Rhythmic Side Stroke Drill** 

- Start in a side position with your arms extended above your head and legs extended.
- Begin the scissor kick while simultaneously performing the side stroke arm movements.
- Focus on maintaining a smooth and fluid motion, ensuring that your arms and legs work together in a coordinated manner.
- Emphasize the rhythm of the stroke, making it relaxed and efficient.

### Poor Body Position, Causing Excessive Drag

Poor body position is a common mistake that leads to excessive drag. Swimmers frequently face this issue when they neglect their core engagement or allow their focus to drift from maintaining proper alignment. When the body is not held in a streamlined position, particularly with sinking hips or legs, it causes increased resistance in the water.

**Horizontal Body Position Drill** 

- Swim a few lengths of the pool, focusing on keeping your body as horizontal as possible.
- Engage your core muscles and imagine a straight line from your head to your toes.
- Avoid allowing your legs or hips to sink, as this can create drag and slow you down.
- Practice maintaining a streamlined body position to improve your efficiency in the water.

### Difficulty in Switching Sides Smoothly

Some swimmers find switching sides smoothly challenging, often due to a lack of practice or difficulty coordinating the movements on both sides. This struggle can interrupt the continuous rhythm of the stroke, leading to lost momentum and increased energy expenditure.

**Side Switch Drill**

- Start by swimming in the side stroke on one side for a set distance.
- When you're ready to switch sides, roll over onto your other side, keeping your body position aligned.
- As you switch sides, coordinate the arm and leg movements accordingly, ensuring a seamless transition.
- Practice this drill to develop the ability to switch sides smoothly and maintain a continuous stroke rhythm.
