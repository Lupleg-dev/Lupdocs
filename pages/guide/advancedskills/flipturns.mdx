Flip turns are a vital swimming skill used to change direction at the end of a pool without breaking stroke or losing momentum. This technique is often used in freestyle or backstroke, and mastering it can significantly improve your swim efficiency and speed.

## Understanding Flip Turns 

A flip turn involves a somersault-like motion underwater, followed by a push off from the pool wall with your feet, which propels you to continue swimming in the opposite direction. It's essentially a quick and efficient way to turn around without losing speed or momentum. 

## Steps to Learning Flip Turns

### Practice Somersaults in the Water

Before attempting flip turns, start with getting comfortable doing somersaults in the water.

**Exercise:**

**Position:** Start in the shallow end of the pool, ideally where you can stand. Position yourself a comfortable distance away from the wall.

**Somersault:** With a deep breath, tuck your chin towards your chest, pull your knees towards your chest, and use your core to roll forward. 

**Complete the Roll:** Continue the roll until you're back to an upright position, and then stand. 

Repeat the process until you're comfortable with somersaulting in the water.

### Approach the Wall

Incorporating the wall into your somersault is the next step. 

**Position:** Start swimming freestyle towards the wall.

**Approach:** As you approach the wall, about an arm's length away, start your somersault. 

**Somersault:** Do a forward roll, tucking in your chin and pulling your knees to your chest. The momentum from your swimming should assist with the flip.

### Push Off the Wall 

The next step is to use the wall to push off and initiate your turn.

**Approach:** Similar to the previous exercise, swim towards the wall. 

**Somersault:** Start your somersault when you're about an arm's length away. 

**Position for Push:** As you roll, extend your legs and plant your feet on the wall, with your knees bent at a comfortable angle. 

**Push Off:** Push off from the wall, straightening your legs, and extend your body into a streamlined position.

### Adding the Twist

Now, we'll add the twist for transitioning into swimming.

**Exercise:**

**Approach:** Swim towards the wall and begin your somersault as usual.

**Position for Push:** Plant your feet on the wall with your knees bent.

**Push Off:** As you push off, start to twist your body to one side. This will position you onto your side or stomach, ready to swim.

**Streamline:** Extend into a streamlined position, just below the surface of the water.

**Glide & Swim:** Kick off into a glide, then break into your freestyle stroke. 

Practice this sequence until it becomes fluid and you can seamlessly transition from the turn into swimming.

### Focusing on Breath Control

One critical aspect of flip turns is breath control. You should exhale through your nose during the turn to avoid water rushing up it.

**Exercise:**

**Approach:** As before, swim towards the wall.

**Exhale:** As you begin your somersault, start to exhale slowly through your nose. Continue exhaling as you flip and push off the wall.

### Timing

The last aspect is the timing of your flip turn. You want to start your turn so that your feet land on the wall just below the surface.

**Exercise:**

**Approach:** Swim towards the wall, judging the distance for your flip.

**Start the Flip:** Begin your somersault at the right time so your feet land on the wall just below the surface.

**Push, Twist, and Swim:** Complete your flip turn as before, pushing off, twisting, extending, gliding, and resuming swimming.

## Additional Tips

**Use your core:** Your abs should be doing most of the work during the flip. If your neck is sore, you're likely not using your core enough.

**Streamline:** Remember to keep your body as streamlined as possible during the push-off and glide to maximize efficiency and speed.

**Practice:** Flip turns can be tricky at first. Practice is key to mastering the timing and technique.
