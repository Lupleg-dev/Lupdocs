# Going Underwater

Getting comfortable underwater as a beginner swimmer takes time and practice. Start with small steps, gradually increasing your comfort level in the water.

## Start with Small Steps

Begin by putting your face in the water and blowing bubbles. Start at the shallow end of the pool or while standing in the water. This exercise will help you gradually get comfortable with having your face in the water. You can also try submerging your entire head underwater and holding your breath for a few seconds. Take your time and gradually increase the duration of time you spend with your face in the water.

## Practice Breathing and Staying Calm

Before going underwater, take a deep breath and hold it. When you're ready, exhale slowly through your nose or mouth as you submerge. This will help you stay calm and composed while swimming. Practice breathing in and out while your face is in the water, focusing on taking slow, deep breaths. This will improve your lung capacity and overall comfort in the water.

## Practice Opening Your Eyes Underwater

Once you feel more at ease with having your face in the water, start practicing opening your eyes underwater. This is an important skill for swimming without goggles or in case your goggles become loose or come off while swimming. Submerge your face in the water and gradually open your eyes. Initially, it might feel unusual, but with practice, you'll become accustomed to it. Try looking around underwater and focusing on objects to enhance your visual acuity without relying on goggles.

## Use Goggles as a Confidence Booster

Wearing goggles can greatly enhance your underwater experience and boost your confidence while swimming. Goggles provide clear and distortion-free vision, allowing you to enjoy your time in the water without concerns of irritation or blurry sight. They also offer a layer of protection for your eyes. Experiment with different types of goggles to find a comfortable fit that doesn't leak. Ensure the straps are properly adjusted for a snug fit that keeps water out.

## Dealing with Loose Goggles

Occasionally, goggles can become loose while swimming, causing distraction and discomfort. If you notice your goggles loosening, try to find a convenient moment to adjust them without interrupting your swim. You can stop at the wall or take a quick break at the pool's edge to tighten the straps and readjust the position of the goggles. This will ensure a better fit and prevent water from leaking in.
