# Introduction

Lupleg Server is the backbone of both [Lupleg Web](https://lupleg.website) and [Lupleg Native](https://lupleg.website) and provides the server infrastructure required to run both client applications.

All Lupleg packages come with the same server included. If you purchased the web plan and want to add on the React Native app later, this will plug into your existing server.
