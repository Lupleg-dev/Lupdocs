# Swimming Etiquette

Swimming is a fantastic activity that promotes health, fitness, and enjoyment for all ages. However, to make sure everyone has a good time, make sure to follow this etiquette:

## Basic Swimming Etiquette

### Respect Others
Always be aware of other swimmers around you and try to avoid getting in their way. Try to be aware of the space around you and avoid taking up too much room with your arms and legs.


### Shower Before Entering the Pool
To maintain the cleanliness of the pool, it's essential to shower before entering. Showering removes any dirt from your body, preventing them from contaminating the pool water. It helps keep the pool clean and makes swimming more enjoyable for everyone.

### No Running
Lifeguards enforce this rule all the time as it's the most common cause of injury. Slippery pool surfaces are easy places for someone to fall and get hurt. Please walk around the pool area to avoid any injuries.

### No Diving in Shallow Water
Make sure the water is deep enough before diving to avoid getting hurt. Not following this can lead to some of the worst injuries you can get while swimming. There's a reason why there are signs that say "No Diving" in shallow water.

## Lane Swimming Etiquette

### Remaining Calm and Considerate
It's important to remain calm and considerate towards other swimmers in the lane. Don't splash excessively, cut off other swimmers, or swim too close to them. It's important to be considerate. Maintain a respectful distance and be mindful of your actions to ensure a positive swimming experience for everyone in the lane.

### Choose the Right Lane 
Lanes are often divided by speed. Select a lane that matches your swimming speed. Check the lane speeds before getting in the pool and choose the one that matches your swimming speed.

### Circle Swimming
In a crowded lane, swimmers should swim in a counter-clockwise circle. Additionally, try to swim alongside the lane rope rather than down the middle of the lane.

### Passing
If you need to pass someone, do so on the left side. Make sure the lane is clear before you pass someone.

If someone is trying to pass you, move towards the lane rope and let them pass.

### Resting
If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane, out of the way of other swimmers. If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane and avoid staying there for too long.

### Entering and Exiting
Before entering or exiting a lane, be aware of other swimmers. Enter and Exit the water gently by stepping in slowly, don't jump.

### Turn at the End of the Lane
When turning at the end of the lane, try to move over to the other side of the lane as you approach. That way, you won't bump into anyone swimming right behind you.
