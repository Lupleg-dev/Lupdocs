# Tasks Reports

## 03/04/24
Implement Tasks and Reports pages with the following features:

- Item header with search bar (not yet functional), and filter
- Items list is modified based on selected filter
- Add a section that displays a detailed description of a report or task
(selected fron the item list)
- Add compose, share and download buttons
- Make use of reusable components to create a cleaner code base

Update on Dashboard component (file: **src/pages/Dashboard.jsx**)
  * Read up on useContext hook. It might be helpful because the **Dashboard.jsx**,
    **Reports.jsx** and **Tasks.jsx** files need to share a state.
  * Connected header and sidebar
  * Created cards (**src/components/dashboard/Cards.jsx**) for the dashboard page.
    Work still needs to be done on the styling.
  * To do:
    - Improve styling of the cards created today
    - Connect task and report cards (these had been created earlier) to the dashboard page.
