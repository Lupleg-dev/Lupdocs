The scissor kick is a powerful and versatile swimming technique that involves a simultaneous scissor-like motion of the legs. It is commonly used in sidestroke, treading water, and breaststroke (In this guide we will be focusing on learning whip kick for breaststroke)

## Learning Scissor Kick

**Body Position and Alignment**

Before focusing on the scissor kick itself, make sure you have proper body position and alignment in the water. Follow these steps:

1. Start in a horizontal position with your body parallel to the pool bottom.
2. Maintain a straight and streamlined body from head to toe.
3. Use your core muscles to stabilize your body.

**Leg Movements and Technique**

Once you have a solid body position, it's time to learn the scissor kick technique. Follow these steps:

1. Begin with your legs extended and close together.
2. Simultaneously move your legs apart in a scissor-like motion, one leg moving forward and the other moving backward.
3. As your legs reach the maximum extension, quickly reverse the motion, bringing the forward leg backward and the backward leg forward.

4. Focus on generating power from your hips and core, driving the scissor kick motion.
5. Keep your legs relatively straight with a slight knee bend.
6. Point your toes slightly to increase surface area and propulsion.
7. Maintain a steady and continuous scissor kick rhythm throughout your swim stroke.

## Improving Scissor Kick

Here are some tips to improve your scissor kick technique:

**Develop Proper Body Alignment and Position:** Pay attention to your body's alignment in the water. Keep your body horizontal and streamline your body position to minimize drag. Extend your arms forward and keep your head aligned with your spine, looking straight down. Maintaining a streamlined body position will help optimize the effectiveness of your scissor kick.

**Engage Core Muscles and Hips:** The power in your scissor kick comes from engaging your core muscles and hips. Focus on strengthening your core through exercises like planks, leg raises, and rotational exercises. By activating your core and driving the movement from your hips, you can generate more power and efficiency in your scissor kick.

**Maintain a Steady and Rhythmic Scissor Kick:** Consistency and rhythm are essential for an effective scissor kick. Avoid jerky or erratic movements that can disrupt your stroke's flow. Aim for a smooth and rhythmic motion, keeping your kicks steady and symmetrical. This will help maintain your momentum and maximize your propulsion in the water.

**Experiment with Angle and Power:** Everyone's body is different, so it's important to find the angle and amplitude of the scissor kick that works best for you. Experiment with different degrees of leg separation and the range of motion in your kick. Some swimmers may benefit from a wider scissor kick, while others may find a narrower kick more effective. Find the sweet spot that allows you to generate power and maintain balance and stability in the water.

## Scissor Kick Drills

To enhance your scissor kick technique and build strength, incorporate the following drills into your practice sessions:

Scissor kick, often used in the breaststroke and sidestroke, is another fundamental swimming skill. Here are some drills to improve your scissor kick technique:

### Wall Push Drill

This drill helps to develop the correct scissor kick movement and strength in the muscles used.

Start by floating vertically in the water near the pool's edge, holding onto the poolside. Extend your legs fully with toes pointed, then perform a scissor kick motion. Your legs should open wide and then squeeze together powerfully to propel your body upward. Do multiple repetitions to build muscle memory and strength.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Perform the drill without holding onto the poolside.
- Add a slight twist in your torso to simulate the sidestroke movement.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Stand in shallow water to practice the kick without floating.

### Kickboard Drill

This drill helps you focus on the kick technique while providing buoyancy.

Start by holding a kickboard with both hands extended in front of you. Push off from the wall and perform the scissor kick, ensuring that one leg moves forward and the other backward before snapping together. The kickboard helps maintain balance and focus on the kick.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Try performing the kick without the kickboard.
- Incorporate a pull with your arms while maintaining the scissor kick.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Use a swimmer's snorkel to remove the need to keep your head above water.

### Dryland Drill

This drill allows you to practice the scissor kick movement on dry land.

Lay flat on your back on a yoga mat or other comfortable surface. Lift your legs slightly off the ground and perform the scissor kick motion, alternating which leg moves forward and which moves back.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Perform the drill with ankle weights.
- Increase the speed of your kicks.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Rest between sets.
- Perform the kick one leg at a time.
