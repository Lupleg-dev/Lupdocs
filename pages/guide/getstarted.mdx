# Get Started

These are the advanced skills that are more difficult to learn and require more practice. These skills are not necessary to safely swim in the water, but they are very useful to know. If you are interested in learning these skills, you should be comfortable with the basic skills and be comfortable swimming in deep water by yourself.
