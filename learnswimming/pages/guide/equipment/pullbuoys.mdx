Pull buoys are widely used in swimming as a training aid to isolate and strengthen the upper body while improving stroke technique. They are buoyant devices typically made of foam that swimmers place between their thighs to provide buoyancy and immobilize their legs.

Benefits:
- **Upper Body Isolation**: Pull buoys allow swimmers to isolate their upper body and focus solely on developing arm and shoulder strength and technique. By immobilizing the legs and relying solely on the upper body for propulsion, swimmers can target specific muscle groups, including the deltoids, biceps, triceps, and latissimus dorsi.
- **Improved Arm Strength**: Regular use of pull buoys helps build upper body strength, enhancing overall arm power and efficiency in the water. The resistance provided by the water challenges the muscles, leading to increased strength and endurance over time.
- **Enhanced Arm Technique**: By eliminating leg movements, pull buoys assist in refining arm technique and efficiency. Swimmers can concentrate on proper arm positioning, catch, pull, and recovery, improving stroke mechanics and speed.
- **Increased Core Engagement**: To maintain stability and balance while using pull buoys, swimmers engage their core muscles, including the abdominals and lower back. This added core engagement helps strengthen the core muscles and improves overall body control in the water.
- **Reduced Leg Fatigue**: Pull buoys relieve the legs from the effort of kicking, allowing swimmers to focus on upper body strength and technique. This can be beneficial for longer training sessions or when swimmers want to emphasize upper body conditioning without exhausting their legs.
- **Versatile Training Tool**: Pull buoys can be used for various training drills, including pull sets, sculling exercises, and stroke-specific drills. Swimmers can target specific aspects of their stroke or focus on improving their catch and pull phases.
- **Assisted Recovery**: Pull buoys can also serve as a recovery tool during training sessions. Swimmers can hold the buoy between their thighs and swim with a relaxed and controlled kick, allowing the upper body to rest and recover while maintaining some level of movement in the water.
