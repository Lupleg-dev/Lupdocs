Swimming goggles are essential equipment for swimmers, providing eye protection and improving underwater visibility. These specialized eyewear are designed to create a watertight seal around the eyes, preventing water from entering and causing discomfort or hindering vision. They are commonly used in various water activities, including competitive swimming, recreational swimming, and diving.

Benefits:
- **Eye Protection**: Swimming goggles safeguard the eyes from irritants such as chlorine, saltwater, and debris, reducing the risk of eye infections or injuries.
- **Enhanced Visibility**: By minimizing water distortion and providing a clear view, goggles improve visibility underwater, allowing swimmers to navigate with confidence and spot obstacles or other swimmers more easily.
- **Comfort and Fit**: Goggles with a well-fitted gasket and adjustable strap offer a comfortable and secure fit, preventing water leakage and minimizing discomfort during prolonged use.
- **Performance Improvement**: With clear vision and reduced eye strain, swimmers can concentrate on their technique, speed, and overall performance, leading to better results in the pool.
- **UV Protection**: Some goggles offer UV protection to shield the eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, particularly when swimming outdoors in sunny conditions.
- **Prescription Goggles**: Swimmers with visual impairments can opt for prescription goggles that are custom-made with their specific lens prescriptions, allowing them to see clearly underwater
