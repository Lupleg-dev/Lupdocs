# Welcome to Lupleg

Welcome to Lupleg! Thank you for your purchase. Your support means a lot to us 🙏🏻

This documentation is split into five sections:


1. Lupleg Server (the back-end Node application)
2. Lupleg Web (the front-end React client)
3. Lupleg Native (the front-end React Native client)
4. Mission Control (the SaaS admin dashboard)
4. Website Template (SaaS website/landing page template)

If you're new to Lupleg, start with the Lupleg Server installation instructions – this is the backbone of both the web and native clients and comes with all Lupleg packages.

Once you've got the server application installed and running, you can work through the Lupleg Web and Lupleg Native installation instructions.
