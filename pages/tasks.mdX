# Task Reports

## 03/04/24
Implement Tasks and Reports pages with the following features:

- Item header with search bar (not yet functional), and filter
- Items list is modified based on the selected filter
- Add a section that displays a detailed description of a report or task
(selected from the item list)
- Add compose, share and download buttons
- Make use of reusable components to create a cleaner code base

**NB** The above is a sample of how it should be done

### Raymond
Update on Dashboard component (file: **src/pages/Dashboard.JSX**)
  * Read up on the `useContext` hook. It might be helpful because of the **Dashboard.JSX**,
    **Reports.jsx** and **Tasks.jsx** files need to share a state.
  * Connect the header and sidebar to the dashboard page.
  * Created cards (**src/components/dashboard/Cards. JSX**) for the dashboard page.
    Work still needs to be done on the styling.
  * To do:
    - Improve styling of the cards created today
    - Connect task and report cards (these had been created earlier) to the dashboard page.
