This technique, also known as the dead man's float, is a useful survival skill in water. It conserves energy and is simple to do, even for beginners.

### Relax 

The first step to a successful survival float is to relax. Panicking will only cause you to expend energy and lose your breath faster. Clear your mind, take deep, controlled breaths, and keep calm.

### Take a Deep Breath

Inhale deeply to fill your lungs with air. This will not only provide your body with oxygen but will also help to naturally buoy you in the water.

### Position Your Body

Once you've taken a deep breath, let yourself lean forward into the water. Your body should naturally want to float with your head tilted downwards and your feet drifting up towards the surface. This is the starting position of the survival float.

### Stay Still

Try not to move around too much. The key to the survival float is to conserve energy, so you want to limit your movements as much as possible. The less you move, the less energy you expend, and the longer you can stay afloat.

### Breathe When Needed

Whenever you need to breathe, carefully lift your head to the side or directly up to take a breath. To do this efficiently, use a gentle pedaling motion with your legs and a small downwards push with your hands to help your mouth clear the water. Try to exhale before you break the surface, then quickly inhale and return to your original position.

### Repeat

Once you've taken a breath, return to your original survival float position and repeat the process. With practice, you can maintain this position and keep breathing for an extended period.
