# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Axios 404 error in the client

The server is not running or the client can not reach it.

Often the node server will not start because there is already an instance of the node running on port 8080. Kill the other instances and try again.

```
killall node
npm run dev // or nodemon in the server folder
```

When the server runs, you will see the Welcome to Lupleg ðŸš€ message in your terminal console.

## CLI toolbet command not found

The setup script will run `npm link` but sometimes it may fail, rerun it manually.

```
npm link
```

## Setup script did not complete

This is usually an issue on certain Windows shells.

Replace the; in the `setup` script in `package.json` with &&

```
"setup": "node bin/installcheck && npm install && npm link && node bin/clientcheck && cd ../client && npm install && cd ../server && node bin/appcheck && cd ../app && npm install && cd ../server && node bin/setup.js && npm run dev",
```

## Email template not found

Run the seed file to populate the database.

```
// sql
node seeds/sql

// mongo
node seeds/mongo
```

## Can't log into Mission Control

`TOKEN_SECRET` in your Mission Control `.env` file does not match the `TOKEN_SECRET` in /server.
