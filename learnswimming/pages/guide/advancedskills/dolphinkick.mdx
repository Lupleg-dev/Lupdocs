Dolphin kick involves simultaneous movement of both legs in an up-and-down motion, much like how a dolphin or mermaid would swim. Unlike the flutter kick used in freestyle and backstroke where the knees have a slight bend, the dolphin kick requires more movement from the hips and a whip-like motion of the legs. The dolphin kick is used in the butterfly stroke and in competitive swimming as a way to move faster underwater.
## Learning the Dolphin Kick

### Understanding Body Movement

**Body Position:** Start by floating on your stomach in the water. Extend your arms in front of you, keeping them close together. Your legs should be extended and close together as well.

**Core Engagement:** The dolphin kick starts from your core, so itâ€™s crucial to engage your abdominal and lower back muscles during this movement. Imagine your body as a long whip, with the motion starting at your chest and moving down to your feet.

### Perfecting the Kick

**Initiate Movement:** Begin the dolphin kick by pressing your chest downwards. As you press your chest down, your hips should naturally move upwards. This creates the initial undulation needed for the dolphin kick.

**Leg Movement:** Following the undulation from your chest and hips, move the 'wave' down to your legs. Let your thighs follow the movement, then your knees, and finally let the wave exit through your feet. The key is to keep your feet and legs together throughout, moving them up and down in unison.

**Amplitude and Speed:** It's important to find the right balance between the amplitude (how big the wave is) and the speed of your kick. Bigger isn't always better; too large of a wave can lead to slower kicks and excessive energy expenditure.

### Breathing and Arm Movement

**Breathing:** For underwater dolphin kicks, you should be holding your breath. When using the dolphin kick in butterfly stroke, you would typically take a breath every one or two strokes, not on every kick.

**Arm Movement:** In underwater dolphin kicking often used in competitive swimming, your arms are typically extended forward. In the butterfly stroke, the arms are moving in a simultaneous sweeping motion.

## Drills to Improve Your Dolphin Kick

**Vertical Kicking:** In deep water, assume a vertical position and perform the dolphin kick. Try to keep your body as straight as possible, using your core muscles. This drill helps build leg and core strength and improve your undulation.

**Board Presses:** Using a kickboard, hold it with both hands and press it down into the water while doing the dolphin kick. This drill emphasizes the chest press portion of the kick.

**Side Kicking:** Perform the dolphin kick while lying on your side. This drill helps enhance your feel of the water and understanding of the wave-like motion.

**Streamline Kicking:** Assuming a streamlined position (hands together above your head), perform the dolphin kick on your front, back, and each side. This drill aids in developing a symmetrical kick.
