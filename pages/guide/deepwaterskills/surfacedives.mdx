# Surface Dives


Surface diving is a vital skill for swimmers, especially those interested in scuba diving and is an essential skill for lifeguards to learn. It involves diving from the surface of the water to below, either head-first or feet-first.

## Head-First Surface Dive:

### Preparation
Start by swimming or floating on the surface of the water, facing the direction you want to dive. Make sure your mask or goggles are secure, if you're using them. It's essential to take a deep breath right before you begin your dive - this will provide the oxygen you need while underwater.

### Streamline position
Bring your arms together above your head in a streamlined position, with your hands clasped together and your biceps close to your ears. Think of your body as a needle cutting through the water - the straighter and more streamlined you are, the more smoothly and efficiently you can dive.

### Submerging
While maintaining the streamlined position, bend at the waist and start to angle your upper body downwards. As your head and chest begin to submerge, kick your legs to propel yourself further underwater.

### Resurfacing
When you're ready to return to the surface, rotate your body to be straight and kick your legs to propel yourself upwards. As you ascend, exhale slowly to prevent any pressure buildup in your ears, again maintaining the streamlined position to cut through the water efficiently.

## Feet-First Surface Dive:

### Upright Position
Begin your dive by floating or treading water in an upright position. Your body should be vertical with respect to the water surface. Inhale deeply before you start your dive. This breath will need to last until you return to the surface.

### Begin the Dive 
Start the dive by bending your knees and pushing off from the surface with your legs. Use your arms to help drive your body downwards, like the sculling motion in this video.

Try to keep your body as straight as possible. Imagine you're sliding down a pole - your body should remain vertical throughout the entire dive.

### Descent
Continue to use the sculling motion with your hands and allow your body to sink deeper into the water. You can also use gentle kicks to control your descent. Remember, patience and control are key - don't rush, but let your body sink naturally.

### Resurfacing
As with the head-first surface dive, exhale slowly as you ascend to prevent any pressure buildup in your ears.S
