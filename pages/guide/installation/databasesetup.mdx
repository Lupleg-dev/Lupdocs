# Database Setup


You'll need an empty database for storing your application data, so go ahead and set up a new one using your favourite database service.

You don't need to create any tables or documents â€“ Gravity will do that automatically for you.

```
MySQL & Mongo database drivers are included by default. If you're using another database client eg. Postges then please install the relevant driver with npm.
```

Take note of your database credentials, you'll need these during the setup process.

```
If you're using a local instance of MongoDB you will need to remove srv from the connection string after your run the setup process. See below.
```

```
// change this line in model/mongo
const url = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.DB_USER}:${encodeURIComponent(process.env.DB_PASSWORD)}@${process.env.DB_HOST}/${process.env.DB_NAME}`;
```

```
// to this
const url = `mongodb://${process.env.DB_USER}:${encodeURIComponent(process.env.DB_PASSWORD
```
